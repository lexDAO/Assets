# ~~~⚖️~~~⚒️ BUIDL Asset
These come from
1.  External raids
2.  Joint ventures (agreement) usually unincorporated
3.  External contribution (donation)
4.  Internal assignment (used LexDAO resources) eg work for membership
5.  Paid staff = from committee work (or CC0)

Assets (alienated from treasury) are available for any grant submission to request, ETHcution depending on the smart contracts mutually convenated. For convenience (as usually composite) can be on the cyberphysical spectrum of:
- _Hard_ (eg signed books as hackathon prizes)
- _Firm_ (control of smart contracts for specific events)
- _soft_ (brevet lvl boost to repo so bypass normal checks) ... xref 1st responder protocol
- _wet_ (committed time of LEETH-holders, L'experts or call upon l'extern work for membership)
- _vapor_ (concepts which require access to brands, IP titles or secret keys)

Smart contracts mediate at different levels of assets to members via roles (hats) at level (not exhaustive):
1. who can access - typically black/grey/white list style, FIFO/LIFO queues, TCRs
2. operation - specific powers constrained by delegated duties encapsulated in a role (aka hat)
3. ownership - typically allocated/held at a committee lvl  (tied to a specific authority)
4. mint - new assets that appear/expire are minted - eg NFT fab for official LexDAO events
5. constitutional - high-level smart contracts persuant to specific clauses (eg voting)

Keys and protocols to add/remove keyholders to specific assets are documented under each asset
SecOps is the purview of the rotating @Ops reporting to the OC

```lvl2+ paladin``` are tasked with issuing necessary lvl1 EOI - (bounties/quests) to document LexDAO assets, add hooks and generally automate the process of tasks/activities one level below, charged against 
- specific reimbursement against 🤜🤛 (as evidenced in electronic records) by authorised hat wearer (limited by role)
- formal request as per Grant Committee guidelines for new assets
- maintainence line items attached to specific assets (eg consulting hours wrt IP in case of infringement brought to attention)

# Workflow of Asset Upgrading (ranking quest)

| Normal | Special | Emergency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Do-ocracy | Jury | BDFL (add)|
| find repo | poll members | chaotic good descends |
| fork (permisisonless)/PR/~~EOI~~ | CfP/raid/srCRED

Special situation happens when there is no EOI and something needs to be done. In this situation, 
1. evidence of data-driven decision (eg temp poll of affected parties),
2. failure mode on consulted/informed opt-{in/out)
3. lodge issue as to intent of the ad-hoc jury
4. a special EOI will be ticketed which may require time-locked staking (no pets)
5. the special EOI then has same powers as normal EOI
6. however the PR **must** be tagged with the issue
7. scCRED will determine the performance of participants
8. ratification of EOI at +1 lvl or delegated authority
9. post-mortem to examine why special situation (eg deriliction of duty)

An emergency is a sparse version of special but step 9 **must not** be omitted.

The following are legacy tasks from lvl5 cryptowizard and apart from
– 🛠️ [**Legal Engineer NFT Registry**](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba2e37f18b647f19aa2e48581729fc4d0131b270) which has been claimed by lvl4DAOsigner to refactor into lvl3- ranking quest for paladins, are open. 
- the full list should be open until 2Q2024 where you **speak by then, or forever till your piece**.
