# MetaFactory

As per snapshot [rabbithole](https://snapshot.org/#/lexdao.eth/proposal/0xd1c6eb4dd0d194b107e2a70f02d09bc976f1273b3a78169f0f022220335be258) via [hackMD](https://github.com/lexDAO/hackmd/blob/main/DAO%20Coalition%20%27startup%20package%27%20execSum.md) the GrantsCommittee should still have ~20 softcaps with `codeslaw` printed on front and `is law` on back ready to ship by [MetaFactory](https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/codeslaw-hat).

But it appears all sold out. I presume the funds from MetaFactory have been inbound and we need to do some magic to order more?
